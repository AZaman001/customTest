# customTest
Built a custom Flask app to test in the CI/CD process with Docker, Wercker, and eventually OCIR and OKE

Note: I no longer have access to OKE instance I deployed to, but the files should definitely clarify the process by which you can successfully automatically dockerize and deploy a Python web app using Wercker and deploy it to OKE (Oracle Kubernets Engine).
